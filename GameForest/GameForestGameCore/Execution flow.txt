When a player creates a lobby:

- the server will give the player a turn number
- the player will be added to the LobbySession table of the database with the owner property set to 'true'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a player joins a lobby:

- the server will give the player a turn number
- the player will be added to the LobbySession table of the database but with the owner property set to 'false'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the "host" sends the message GFX_START_GAME to the server:

- the server sends GFX_START_GAME to other clients
- other clients will send GFX_START_GAME_CONFIRM indicating they've received the GFX_START_GAME message
- if all clients has sent a GFX_START_GAME_CONFIRM, the server will send a GFX_START to indicate the clients
  the game has started

The game will then start with the "host" as the first player playing the game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the "player" sends the message GFX_NEXT_TURN to the server:

- the server finds the next player
- the server locks the last player from uploading data (uploading data should be before sending GFX_NEXT_TURN
  which should be automatically handled by the SDK's API.)
- the server grants the next player access to modifying the data of the game.
- the server gets data relevant for the next player to get (game data, user list, etc.)

This will be the flow of the game until someone sends a GFX_GAME_FINISH to the server.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a "player" sends the message GFX_GAME_FINISH to the server:

- the server will send back a GFX_GAME_FINISH_TALLY message to the client informing the client should start
  computing who won the game.
- the server will grant the client access to the game data for score tallying
- the client should compute for who won the game and will send a GFX_GAME_FINISH_TALLY to the server
- the server will send a GFX_GAME_FINISH to other clients (along with the score tally data) informing
  the game has finished.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Game data locking:

- the game data is locked to players that is not currently their turn
- although a player can send and read his own data to the server
- the server will send a GFX_GAME_DATA_UPDATED message to all clients (not including the callee) should a
  client send a GFX_SEND_DATA or a GFX_SEND_PLAYER_DATA message to the server


Game turn processing:

- the game will first process the player's turn before going to the actual 

Client disconnections:

- a client can reconnect to a game provided the client has the UserSessionId and LobbySessionId stored in
  the browser's database
- upon reconnection, the client will send a GFX_CLIENT_RECONNECTED message to the server
- the server will then send a GFX_GAME_DATA_UPDATED to the client
