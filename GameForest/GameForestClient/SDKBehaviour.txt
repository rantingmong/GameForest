The game forest SDK will run when it has both UserSessionId and LobbySessionId stored in the local
database of the browser.

The SDK will have function delegates for the developer to place in their code. The delegates are:

gfxOnGameStart();                           called when the game is started
gfxOnTurnStart();                           called when the player's turn has started
gfxOnUpdateData(gameData: GFXGameData);     called when the game's data is updated
gfxOnGameFinish();                          called when the game is finished
gfxOnGameTally(tallyInfo: GFXTallyInfo);    called when the game's score should be computed

In addition, the SDK will have functions for the developer to get information from:

gfxGetUserList() : GFXUserInfo[];           returns the list of players playing the game
gfxGetUserInfo() : GFXUserInfo;             returns a user information of a player playing the game
gfxGetGameInfo() : GFXGameInfo;             returns a descriptive information of the game being played

gfxAskGameData() : String;                  returns the current data state of the game
gfxAskUserGameData() : String;              returns the current user data state of a player

The SDK will also have functions to place information to the server:

gfxFinishGame();                            function to inform the server the game has ended
gfxSendGameData(payload: String);           function to send game data to the server
gfxSendUserData(payload: String);           function to send user game data to the server
